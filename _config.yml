  Developer, Father, Board Game Player, that's the background

  Honestly, I'm a 30ish years old developer, who at a certain point in my life realized that software development is like Lego Bricks. I've always loved to build stuff with this bricks, and building software for me is 90% fun and 10% job.

  Coding for life. I love writing code, and as a developer, the world is an infinite source of inspiration. Every time I see some problem, I stop to think of a way to solve this problem with some kind of software, code or script. As a person, It's my responsibility to share all my knowledge with the world. This way, even if I die, my ideas will pass on.
  If you like to code, build plastic brick's towers and play some video and board games, just come with me on my magical journey through this big project called life.
