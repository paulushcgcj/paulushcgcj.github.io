# Welcome to My Professional Journey

Born and raised in the vibrant city of São Paulo, I inherited a rich cultural heritage from my parents—a Capoeira professor and a skilled seamstress—who instilled in me the values of discipline, creativity, and perseverance. Their influence, combined with my innate curiosity and passion for technology, set the stage for my journey into the world of software development.

I embarked on my educational path at Faculdades Oswaldo Cruz, where I graduated in 2012 with a degree in System Development and Analysis. However, my quest for knowledge did not end there. Fuelled by a relentless drive for self-improvement, I embraced the role of a self-taught developer, continuously honing my skills and expanding my expertise across various programming languages and technologies.

In addition to mastering the intricacies of software development, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth, teaching myself the English language—a pivotal skill that has opened doors to new opportunities and facilitated collaboration on a global scale. Today, I stand as a testament to the power of determination and lifelong learning, ready to make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
