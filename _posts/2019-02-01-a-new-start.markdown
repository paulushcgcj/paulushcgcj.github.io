**Top of the morning for you**

This is a new beginning for this blog. It will serve as a starting point on this new journey in our lives, and I say wow because my wife and I will try to update this space whenever possible. Several things will start to change from this `date`, so mark your calendars.

Another point to be discussed, you will notice (and I hope you will) that the blog icon is a wolf, and that is something interesting. Recently we were discussing a symbol for our family, something that represents the **Cruz** family as unique and shows how we are, and so after some research, we found the wolf as an excellent representative. We found a website with some meanings and one of them really fit with what we expected, and it was with the following text that we really bought into the idea of the wolf:

> The Native Wolf Symbol represents loyalty, strong family ties, good communication, education, understanding and intelligence. Of all land animals, the Wolf has the strongest supernatural powers and is the most accomplished hunter. The Wolf is a very social and communicative creature, he uses body movement, touch and sound. 

So we started discussing how to assemble and what to put, and we ended up with the image below. The color gray was also chosen to represent a certain somberness, considering that opulence is not our strong suit (anyone who knows me knows that I walk around like a beggar). The phrase just below the family name demonstrates an ideal that I have tried to follow since I had to take over the reins, never running away from challenges, never running away from responsibility. It's harder than it seems, but you can't run away from everything in life.

What does this new beginning represent? I can't say at the moment, but it was something big enough to change the direction of our lives once and for all. From now on nothing can stop us.

Taking advantage, I'm going to post some old content from some articles I wrote and start writing more frequently too.

See you next time.
