The Old Ladies is a tic-tac-toe game developed using MonoGame. It is a classic game where two players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This is the first game I've made and it's just my exploratory take on how to write games with MonoGame. It'e been a fun and exciting experience, as I've been strugling with game development for a few years. For context (if you didn't noticed yet) I'm a seasoned software developer, been working in a lot of big and small projects since 2010 and writing software was never an issue for me, but games.... games hit me differently.

After a ton of frustrated attempts of making a simple game, I've decided to start a simple and small game, a simple puzzle to get used to the framework and platform itself. The language, C# is one of the first languages I've learned, but never mastered, but it was always a language that I kept in my heart, so this wasn't a blocker for me. MonoGame is a new take on the former XNA framework created by Microsoft. This is something I've always liked, as it gave me the tools to make whatever I want, instead of giving me a more restrict approach. So now let's get back to the game.
